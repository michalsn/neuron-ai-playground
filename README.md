# NeuronAI Playground

A personal playground for experimenting with [NeuronAI](https://github.com/inspector-apm/neuron-ai).

This repository currently includes a simple example demonstrating how to build an AI-powered workflow using Agents, Tools, and API calls.

For a walkthrough of this example, check out the [related blog post](https://michalsn.dev/posts/getting-started-with-neuronai-workflows/).
